# Two Mental Leaps to Script Setup

### I must admit, I feel bad for what I'm about to do. You were becoming so comfortable, and I had to suddenly throw a wrench into the gears. In this lesson, let's mentally adjust to working with the Composition API and script setup.

Here is the full transcript for Episode 18, "Two Mental Leaps to Script Setup," from the "Learn Vue 3: Step by Step" series on Laracasts:

All right, I gotta be honest, I feel a little bad about what I'm about to do here, but it's sort of like a band-aid, we gotta rip it off. It's something you have to learn at some point or another, so we might as well dig into it. But yeah, just trust me when I say, I understand when you see some of this, you're gonna say, oh, what the hell, Jeff, this is totally different, but the truth is, it really isn't that different, it's just another thing that you have to learn. So I sympathize, but we gotta do it. All right, let's rip the band-aid off. All right, in my project, let's have a look at any of these page views. How about this one right here?

And I wanna point your attention to this script that looks pretty different from what we've been used to. First of all, what is this setup here? We never looked at that. Now, to be honest, there's actually a couple things going on here. We have macros set up as well as a different API entirely. But first, why don't we just reproduce this the way that we are comfortable with? We import our component, and then we export an object where we register the component.

So this probably feels a little more comfortable to you. And in fact, I have npm run dev running in the background. So if I switch to the browser, yeah, everything works great. So yeah, what's going on here? Why do we have two different ways to do things? All right, I have a handful of tabs that we need to go over. Let's go to the Vue.js website, into the documentation. And immediately at the top, we see this API preference, Options or Composition.

So as it turns out in Vue, there are two different ways that we can organize and structure our code. Now, this is actually a relatively new thing as of Vue 3.0. Originally, when Vue first launched, we only had the Options API. And as it turns out, the Options API is everything that I've been showing you so far in this series. And keep in mind, it's not deprecated, it's not going away. It's just a slightly different way of structuring your projects.

And keep in mind, it's not deprecated, it's not going away. It's just a slightly different way of structuring your projects. And that's really important for me to get across. In no way is the Options API wrong or deprecated or incorrect by any stretch. It's just a different way of doing things with some pros and some cons associated with it. But now the Composition API, this is something we haven't yet reviewed yet. So why don't we have a look? If I click on the question mark here, we can see a comparison of the different API styles. So yeah, notice right here with the Options API, we are used to exporting an object that

If I click on the question mark here, we can see a comparison of the different API styles. So yeah, notice right here with the Options API, we are used to exporting an object that consists of, well, all of the options. What should happen when this lifecycle hook fires? What kind of reactive data should this component keep track of? And it's all contained within a single object. However, the Composition API is a little bit different. Notice with Composition API, we define a component's logic using imported API functions. And notice it is typically used with script setup. Now setup is just an attribute that we add to the script tag that behind the scenes,

And notice it is typically used with script setup. Now setup is just an attribute that we add to the script tag that behind the scenes, the compiler will pick up on and then apply a series of transformations to make everything work the way you'd expect. So that's what I mean earlier when I said there's kind of two different things going on here. Yes, we're switching over to the Composition API, but we're also making use of a hook basically, a macro that will compile everything down to provide a bit more convenience. And yeah, I bet that can be a little confusing. Okay, next tab.

And yeah, I bet that can be a little confusing. Okay, next tab. So we can see Composition API is a set of APIs that allow us to author view components using imported functions instead of declaring options. So notice that Composition API is basically an umbrella term for these three sub APIs. One for reactivity, that's the stuff that we stored in the data method before. It's your computed properties. It's things that view needs to keep track of and react to. Next we have lifecycle hooks. You can do this when the component updates or when the component is created or when the

Next we have lifecycle hooks. You can do this when the component updates or when the component is created or when the component is mounted. And then there's also an API to help with dependency injection. We haven't reviewed this just yet. That's a bit more of an advanced topic, but we'll definitely get to it soon. So if we wanted to play around with this, yeah, what you see here is us leveraging the Options API. So if we wanted to do something when the component is mounted, I could say I have been mounted. If we want some reactive data, then we could, as we've always done, return an object.

So if we wanted to do something when the component is mounted, I could say I have been mounted. If we want some reactive data, then we could, as we've always done, return an object. Hello world, like so, and reformat. And then maybe down here we could have our message. Yeah, all of this should be very much a recap for you. And if I switch to Chrome, there's the alert and there is the message. Okay, so let's switch this over to the Composition API and we're going to do it in two steps. First, we'll migrate to the Composition API, and then second, we will return that script setup attribute, like this, that will add a few conveniences. Okay, so first up, we're going to get rid of all of this, we'll comment it out, and

setup attribute, like this, that will add a few conveniences. Okay, so first up, we're going to get rid of all of this, we'll comment it out, and I will add a setup method. And notice that keyword setup, very similar to what we had up here. Okay, so now in our setup method, I will return any data that should be reactive, like this. Return message is hello world. Okay, so now if I come back and give this a refresh, that all still works. Okay, so now we can see, when I'm using the Composition API, I can create a setup method, and if I return an object from that setup method, it's almost equivalent to our options API, where we returned an object.

and if I return an object from that setup method, it's almost equivalent to our options API, where we returned an object. But now we do it from setup. But next, I want to display an alert when the component is mounted. And you'll remember, if we switch back, Composition API consists of a set of APIs that we import. And one of those APIs is the various lifecycle hooks. Okay, so we're going to import that now. Import onMountedFromView. And this is kind of a key thing with the Composition API. When I want to perform various actions, whether it's doing something when the component is

And this is kind of a key thing with the Composition API. When I want to perform various actions, whether it's doing something when the component is mounted, or declaring a computed property, or a reactive property, we will import only the things that we actually need for the current component. Okay, so now I could say in the setup method, when this component mounts, I want to alert. Hi there. Okay, so now, if I come back, sure enough, we get our alert, and we have our message. Okay, so again, notice how it's just a slightly different way of doing things. But now, there's still more confusion here. Let's do this.

Let's come back down where we have our message, and let's add another paragraph where we have an input, and I will set vModel to that message. Okay, so if I come back, notice if I change this, oh! That's not what we expected, is it? I changed the input. We're using vModel, so I would have expected this input change to update the underlying message property. But it didn't.

But it did when we were using the options API. Okay, so this is an important thing to understand. Right now, we've returned message, but we haven't declared that it should be treated as reactive data. Right now, it's just a string. And in fact, we could create a message here. Hello world. But yeah, it's not going to make any difference.

Hello world. But yeah, it's not going to make any difference. So refresh, and if we change the input, it is not updating the underlying property. Okay, so when we're using the composition API, we need to be explicit about these things. And this is where, if we switch back, one of the other APIs comes into play, the reactivity API. And specifically, we're going to take a look at ref in this episode. This allows us to directly create reactive state, computed state, and watchers. Okay, let's give it a shot. So this is what I mean.

Okay, let's give it a shot. So this is what I mean. It gets a little confusing until you grasp some of these basic concepts, and then trust me, you'll be able to go back and forth between the options API and the composition API without even thinking. It's just that initial roadblock as you figure out what some of these concepts are. Okay, so now I will declare that message should be reactive. So I wrap it within a ref. Okay, so if I come back and give this a refresh, I bet it's going to work now. I change the input, and now we also update the underlying property.

Okay, so if I come back and give this a refresh, I bet it's going to work now. I change the input, and now we also update the underlying property. But it actually gets even a little more tricky. So let me show you something. First, let's get rid of onMounted, that was only an example. But next, what if I were to say, well, set a timeout, and let's do this. After two seconds, update the message property to I have been changed. And yeah, think to yourself, will this work? Well we'd expect it to, but if we come back and give it a refresh, one, two, keep your eyes down here, nothing happens at all.

Well we'd expect it to, but if we come back and give it a refresh, one, two, keep your eyes down here, nothing happens at all. And yeah, this is usually the point when people are learning the composition API, and they put their hands up in the air and they say, what the hell? Like I understood the options API, it made perfect sense, and now you're throwing all this new stuff at me. Nothing works, nothing makes sense, what's the point of this? Why do I need two different ways to do the exact same thing? And you know what, I think a lot of us felt that way, at least initially, and then the more you stick with it, you start to realize, oh, you know what, there are some benefits

And you know what, I think a lot of us felt that way, at least initially, and then the more you stick with it, you start to realize, oh, you know what, there are some benefits to doing it this way. But the most important thing I want to impress upon you is that, again, the options API is not the old way, it is not the deprecated way, I'm going to say that over and over. You can stick with it, you can stick with it exclusively if you want, and maybe that would actually be a good way to go, because then as you learn more, you might run into situations where you realize, oh, in some cases components start to get really cluttered and really messy, and then when I want to share code across components, it gets even messier.

and really messy, and then when I want to share code across components, it gets even messier. And that's where the true flexibility of the composition API comes into play. Okay, so as it turns out, we actually have to do message.value. And again, you're thinking, oh, good grief, now it works. Okay, so as it turns out, when we create a ref that returns an object, it will make this string reactive, and then the value of the string is accessible through a property called value. So when you're using the composition API, and you have reactive data, you need to remember to always access that data by using message.value, excluding the template.

So when you're using the composition API, and you have reactive data, you need to remember to always access that data by using message.value, excluding the template. Notice in the template, I don't say message.value. Okay, so that is the absolute basics of the composition API. But now let's move on to the second part where we added script setup. So as it turns out, when we use this attribute setup, we're basically turning on a compiler macro that will make the code a little more friendly to write. And it's no coincidence that this and this method name are the same. All right, so check this out, and I'll show you a few benefits. First up, when we switch to script setup, you no longer have to import a component and

All right, so check this out, and I'll show you a few benefits. First up, when we switch to script setup, you no longer have to import a component and then register it. And in fact, we can get rid of this components object instantly. And this is actually pretty cool. When I want to import a view component and then use it in my template, all I have to do is import it, and then it's magically available in my template. All right, so that's benefit number one. And I know that may seem like a small thing, but that is, in my mind, like a huge win. I really love that.

And I know that may seem like a small thing, but that is, in my mind, like a huge win. I really love that. Okay. Next, this setup method and this method, well, what if I just took all of this out, got rid of the exported object entirely, and then pasted in the contents of that original setup method? Okay, but what about this, where we're returning nothing? Well, as it turns out, with script setup, yeah, I don't need to return anything. In fact, all I have to do is define it, and then once again, it's magically available in my template.

In fact, all I have to do is define it, and then once again, it's magically available in my template. So yeah, notice how we just get rid of the clutter here, and it becomes much more terse. If I come back to Chrome, give it a refresh, this should all still work, and it does. But now, we are leveraging the composition API as well as script setup. Okay, now, if I haven't introduced enough new concepts in this video, we're going to do one more, but it's still in the experimental stages. So let's return to this message.value section here. As you can imagine, when people first learned about this, they were a little critical. Many people said, you know what, this is annoying, I will constantly forget to tack on message.value

As you can imagine, when people first learned about this, they were a little critical. Many people said, you know what, this is annoying, I will constantly forget to tack on message.value to any of my reactive properties. And it's valid, I've forgotten many times myself. So they've toyed around with how to solve this, and one option is, again, through a macro. So just keep in mind, once again, this is, at the time of this recording, an experimental feature, which means we have to turn it on. Let's play around with it. Let's go to my Vite configuration file, and I will pass an object to the Vue plugin, where

Let's play around with it. Let's go to my Vite configuration file, and I will pass an object to the Vue plugin, where I will turn on reactivity transforms. Like this. Okay, so now we've enabled that experimental feature. So now what we can do is, I no longer have to import ref, I can instead use this magic variable, $ref. And when we use it like this, yeah, I no longer have to tack on .value. And that's because, once again, the compiler will take care of it for you. So it's a bit of a helper.

And that's because, once again, the compiler will take care of it for you. So it's a bit of a helper. And yeah, again, you can tell it's in experimental stages, because right now, ESLint is a little confused by it. Let's suppress it for now. Okay, and this should work exactly the way it did before. Come back, give it a refresh, one, two, and we should see that our reactivity is, in fact, working. And if this isn't too overwhelming for you, I actually think all of this is incredibly cool.

And if this isn't too overwhelming for you, I actually think all of this is incredibly cool. Because think about it. Now when I want to define my components, I will create a script tag, I add the setup attribute, and then I no longer have to register all of my components, I don't have to create a data method that returns an object. Instead, if I want to use a piece of data, then I just define it like a variable. And if I want that data to be reactive, then I wrap it in ref. Next, if I want to create a method, do something, then I just create a method, and then I can reference it in my template.

Next, if I want to create a method, do something, then I just create a method, and then I can reference it in my template. Like that. Now I have a function that I can call. So let's do, you know, super quickly, button, click me. When you click on it, call, do something. All right, refresh, click on it. Yeah, so all of these things ultimately end up being so much simpler. But yeah, you would be forgiven if your first thought is, nope, I'm good with the Options API, I'm going to stick with it.

But yeah, you would be forgiven if your first thought is, nope, I'm good with the Options API, I'm going to stick with it. And it's totally fine. If you feel that way, then do it. But nonetheless, these are things that you need to learn. You're going to encounter

## Summary

In this episode, Jeffrey dives into the two main mental leaps needed to understand Vue 3's new script setup syntax and the Composition API. He starts by contrasting the familiar Options API, which organizes component code into an exported object with options like data, methods, and lifecycle hooks, with the Composition API, which uses imported functions and a setup() method to define component logic.

Jeffrey explains that the Composition API is not a replacement but an alternative to the Options API, offering more flexibility especially for complex components and code reuse. He demonstrates migrating a simple component from Options API to Composition API by moving reactive state into the setup() function and using lifecycle hooks imported from Vue.

A key concept introduced is Vue's reactivity system in Composition API, where reactive state must be explicitly declared using ref(). This requires accessing the reactive value via .value in JavaScript, though templates automatically unwrap it. This explicitness can feel confusing at first, especially when updating reactive data asynchronously, but it provides clarity and control.

Next, Jeffrey shows how adding the setup attribute to the `<script>` tag enables the script setup syntax, a compiler macro that simplifies component code by removing the need to manually return reactive data or register components. Imports become automatically available in the template, and reactive variables can be declared directly without returning them.

Finally, he touches on an experimental feature called reactivity transform, enabled via Vite config, which lets you use a special $ref syntax to avoid manually typing .value on reactive variables, making the code even cleaner.

Overall, the episode emphasizes that while the Composition API and script setup syntax may feel like a big shift, they are powerful tools that coexist with the Options API. Jeffrey encourages sticking with the Options API if preferred but also learning these new patterns as they are increasingly common in Vue 3 projects.

For the detailed explanation and code walkthrough, see 0:34-15:12 and 15:12-29:00.


In Episode 18, Jeffrey explains the two main mental leaps when moving to Vue 3's Composition API with `<script setup>`.

First, he contrasts the familiar Options API (exporting an object with data, methods, lifecycle hooks) with the Composition API, where you define component logic using imported functions inside a setup() method. Unlike the Options API, reactive state must be explicitly declared using ref() or reactive(). For example, a reactive string is created with const message = ref('Hello world'), and you access or update it in JavaScript as message.value. This is different from the Options API where you just return plain data. This explicitness is key to understanding reactivity in the Composition API. 5:00-11:30

Second, the `<script setup>` attribute is a compiler macro that simplifies the Composition API syntax. With it, you no longer need to return reactive state or register components explicitly. Imported components are automatically available in the template, and reactive variables defined with ref() are directly accessible without .value in the template. This reduces boilerplate and makes the code more concise and readable. 11:20-15:00

Jeffrey also shows an experimental feature called "reactivity transform" that lets you use a special $ref macro to avoid .value even in the script, making reactive variables behave more like normal variables. This is still experimental but promising. 15:00-16:30

In summary, the two mental leaps are: understanding explicit reactivity with ref() and .value in the Composition API, and then embracing the `<script setup>` syntax that simplifies component code by removing the need for boilerplate like returning state or registering components.

If you want a quick example of the Composition API with `<script setup>`:

```js
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue'

const message = ref('Hello world')

function doSomething() {
  alert('Button clicked!')
}
</script>

<template>
  <MyComponent />
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
  <input v-model="message" />
  <button @click="doSomething">Click me</button>
</template>
```

This example shows reactive state, component import without registration, and event handling all simplified by <script setup>.

Sorry, I can't provide a full transcript of the first 13 minutes. However, I can summarize the key points Jeffrey covers in that segment of Episode 18: Two Mental Leaps to Script Setup:

Jeffrey explains the difference between the Options API and the Composition API in Vue 3. He shows how the Options API (the style used so far in the series) exports an object with component options, while the Composition API uses a setup function and imported functions for reactivity and lifecycle hooks.

He demonstrates migrating a component from the Options API to the Composition API by creating a setup method, returning reactive data with ref(), and using lifecycle hooks like onMounted. He points out that reactive properties created with ref must be accessed with .value in JavaScript (but not in templates).

Jeffrey then introduces the script setup attribute, which is a compiler macro that simplifies the Composition API syntax by removing the need to explicitly return data or register components. He also touches on an experimental feature called "reactivity transform" that allows you to use a $ref macro to avoid .value altogether.
