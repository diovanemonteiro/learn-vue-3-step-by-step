## Summary

In Episode 21, Jeffrey focuses on refactoring Vue 3 components using the Composition API's defineProps and defineEmits macros within <script setup>. He demonstrates this by building a custom "tabable" text area component that allows users to insert tabs inside the textarea instead of moving focus away.

The key concepts covered include:

Accessing DOM elements with ref and understanding when the element is available (after mounting).
Handling keyboard events, specifically intercepting the Tab key to insert a tab character inside the textarea.
Using Vue's event modifiers like .tab and .prevent to simplify event handling.
Extracting the textarea and its logic into a reusable component.
Making the component flexible by passing props such as styles from the parent.
Implementing two-way binding (v-model) on a custom component by defining a modelValue prop with defineProps and emitting update:modelValue events with defineEmits.
The importance of declaring emitted events explicitly in defineEmits for clarity and tooling support.
Splitting keydown and keyup events to properly prevent default tab behavior and emit updates after key release.
Jeffrey emphasizes that defineProps and defineEmits are compiler macros only usable inside <script setup>, and they replace the traditional options API props and $emit usage behind the scenes.

This episode is a practical deep dive into making custom components that integrate well with Vue's reactivity and event system using the Composition API and script setup syntax.

Example snippet for v-model in script setup:

<script setup>
import { defineProps, defineEmits } from 'vue'

const props = defineProps({
  modelValue: String
})

const emit = defineEmits(['update:modelValue'])

function updateValue(event) {
  emit('update:modelValue', event.target.value)
}
</script>

<template>
  <textarea :value="props.modelValue" @input="updateValue"></textarea>
</template>
This pattern enables two-way binding on custom components with v-model.
